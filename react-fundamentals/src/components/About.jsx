         <h3>Me Baout</h3>
    <p>
        Me, Charlie Kelly? I'm the wildcard of the Paddy's Pub gang. I write all the best songs, 
        like "The Nightman Cometh" and "Pepe Silvia". Sometimes I get a little confused, but 
        that's just 'cause I'm a fighter. I got a whole lotta rage in me, and sometimes it 
        spills out. But hey, at least I'm passionate, right? 
        I also eat a lot of milksteak - gotta keep up my energy for all this wildcardin'.
